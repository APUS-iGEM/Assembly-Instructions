# Welcome to the APUS Assembly Instructions Repository!
### Whether you saw our project at the 2023 iGEM Jamboree and want replicate our hardware for yourself, or if you heard about us from another source, thank you for your intererst in our hardware and for visiting our page!

#### *Note: We are still in the process of organizing and uploading our documentation! We appreciate your patience!*

Once our documantation is compete, this repository will hold the assembly protocols that accompany the contents of the CAD-files repository and the CODE-files repository. One of our main objectives is to make our hardware completely open source and reproducable. 
As of the Jamboree (Nov 3-7, 223), the three main modules of APUS are completely functional as separate parts, and are functional in APUS when controlled via separate Âµ-controllers and computers. As many iGEM teams also know, the 2023 season went by very quickly, and the integration of our backend with our GUI is a work in progress.

As a team, we are still in the process of making thorough and complete documantation for what we have made so far, and in integrating our separate systems into one, so here we will shorly explain the current state, and the theoretical final state.

#### As of Nov 8, 2023:
The three submodules of APUS; the Dual-Syringe Continuous Pumping System (DSCPM), the Environmental Control Chamber (ECC), and the Motherboard Control System; all function on separate Arduinos. Our experiments where we characterized our hybrid promoter (the proof-of-concept for our hardware) were carried out by controlling the DSCPM, ECC, and Motherboard separately.

#### Immediate Next Steps:
What we are uploading in the APUS-iGEM GitHub: 
1) STL files (which we 3D printed with a Creality Ender and PLA Filament)
   - DSCPM (IN PROGRESS)
   - ECC (UPLOADED)
   - Motherboard Solenoid Holders (IN PROGRESS)
2) Code for the Arduinos
   - DSCPM (IN PROGRESS)
   - ECC (IN PROGRESS)
   - Motherboard Control Solenoids (IN PROGRESS)
3) Circuit/Wiring Diagrams
  - DSCPM (IN PROGRESS)
   - ECC (IN PROGRESS)
   - Motherboard Solenoid Holders (IN PROGRESS)
4) Assembly Protocol/Instructions
   - DSCPM (IN PROGRESS)
   - ECC (IN PROGRESS)
   - Motherboard Solenoid Holders (IN PROGRESS)
5) Experiment Setup and Sterilization Protocols (IN PROGRESS)

   
#### Eventually:
We intend to have the ECC code reside on an Arduino with IoT capabilities, and will include additional code to control the DSCPM and Motherboard via I2C. APUS will be controllable via a dashboard on the Arduino Cloud IoT platform.
